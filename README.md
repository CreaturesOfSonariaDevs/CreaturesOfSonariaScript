## 🔥 Features & Detailed Description

Our script isn't just a single tool — it's a **multi-functional suite** designed for Roblox's Creatures of Sonaria, packed with survival-focused modules:

> 🧬 **Auto Farm System**
Automatically selects and grows the best creature for Shoom farming. Maintains health, hydration, and hunger, while staying in safe zones. Advanced pathfinding keeps your avatar away from other players or hostile entities.

> 🧲 **Item & Token Auto Collect**
Scans the game world for valuable items like event currency, tokens, food, eggs, and rare collectibles. Includes object filtering logic to prioritize the rarest resources.

> ☠️ **Survive Kaiju Protocols**
Detects powerful Kaiju-class creatures and either instantly teleports, heals, or logs you out to preserve your character.

> ❤️‍🩹 **Auto Heal and Recovery**
Automatically uses abilities or stamina mechanics when health falls below a threshold. Heals even while under attack or fleeing.

> 🧘 **Anti-AFK Technology**
Prevents being kicked for inactivity by simulating minimal movement. Ensures your farming continues undisturbed.

> 🎮 **Integrated GUI**
A sleek, user-friendly interface allowing you to toggle modules, select creatures, and view performance without editing scripts.

## 🧾 Additional Chapters

### 🎯 Strategy and Planning

Efficient automation isn't just about enabling a script — it's about planning your sessions. Choose your creature type wisely. Herbivores tend to last longer in AFK zones. Omnivores offer flexibility during item collection events.

### 🦴 Farming Path Optimization

Many users create looped paths using in-game terrain — safe valleys, caves, or edges of maps where spawns are minimal. Using Auto Farm and Auto Collect in those zones can yield great returns with minimal risk.

### 🌑 Event Mode Activation

During Roblox’s seasonal events, token farming becomes vital. This script includes a toggle to switch to **Event Priority Mode**, increasing item detection range and prioritizing limited-time collectibles.
